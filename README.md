# Jia
Hii everyone!
Jia is a Jarvis Inspred Assistant.
This is my final year project on building a virtual assistant.
I have used pyttsx and speech_recognition libraries.
The full source code is shared here.

The development is still under process and will update as soon as a new module gets added.
You can fork the project and do whatever you wanna do. Just include this readme somewhere.
